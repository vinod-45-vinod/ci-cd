## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture

### Stage 1: BUILD ‚úÖ
- **Parallel execution** for frontend, backend, and Python service
- Dependency caching (npm, pip)
- Production build validation
- Build artifacts uploaded

### Stage 2: TEST ‚úÖ
- **Unit tests** for all services
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **System tests** for end-to-end workflows
- Parallel test execution
- Coverage collection during tests

### Stage 3: COVERAGE ‚úÖ (‚â•75% Required)
- **Frontend**: Jest with HTML/LCOV reports
- **Backend**: Jest with threshold enforcement
- **Python**: pytest-cov with HTML/XML reports
- **Quality Gate**: Pipeline FAILS if any service < 75%
- Coverage reports uploaded as artifacts

### Stage 4: LINT ‚úÖ (‚â•7.5/10 Required)
- **Frontend**: ESLint with React rules (zero errors)
- **Backend**: ESLint for Node.js (zero errors)
- **Python**: pylint with 7.5/10 minimum score
- **Quality Gate**: Pipeline FAILS on any error or low score
- Lint reports uploaded as artifacts

### Stage 5: SECURITY ‚úÖ
- **Node.js**: npm audit for vulnerability scanning
- **Python**: bandit for static code analysis
- Critical vulnerability detection
- Security reports uploaded as artifacts

### Stage 6: DEPLOYMENT ARTIFACT ‚úÖ (CRITICAL)
Creates comprehensive package containing:
- Complete source code (all 3 services)
- All CI/CD reports (coverage, lint, security)
- Configuration files (Docker, Docker Compose)
- Documentation (README, deployment manifest)
- Test suites and dependencies
