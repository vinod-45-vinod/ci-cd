## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Review Changes
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Vinod G R\Desktop\article-pdf-app"
git status
```

You should see:
```
modified:   .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
modified:   python_service/main.py
modified:   python_service/requirements.txt
new file:   python_service/test_weasyprint.py
new file:   WEASYPRINT_MIGRATION.md
new file:   MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
new file:   COMPARISON.md
new file:   DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate to WeasyPrint for reliable PDF generation

- Replace xhtml2pdf with WeasyPrint
- Simplify PDF generation code
- Add system dependencies to CI/CD workflow
- Improve PDF quality and CSS support
- Reduce deployment complexity

This addresses issues with:
- Playwright: Heavy browser dependencies
- xhtml2pdf: PDF rendering problems

WeasyPrint provides the optimal balance of features and simplicity."
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Monitor CI/CD Pipeline
1. Go to: https://github.com/vinod-45-vinod/ci-cd/actions
2. Watch the workflow run
3. Verify all stages complete:
   - ✅ Build
   - ✅ Test
   - ✅ Quality Checks
   - ✅ Create Artifacts

### Step 5: Verify Artifacts
After successful run:
1. Download `ci-cd-reports.zip`
2. Download `source-code-clean.zip`
3. Check PDF generation works in the pipeline logs

## 🧪 Expected Pipeline Behavior

### Build Stage
```
📦 Install WeasyPrint system dependencies
✅ WeasyPrint system dependencies installed
📦 Install Python dependencies
✅ Python dependencies installed
```

### Test Stage
```
🧪 Run Python tests
pytest test_main.py -v --cov=main
✅ Python tests completed
```

### Quality Checks Stage
```
📊 Python Coverage
✅ Python coverage generated
🔍 Python Lint
✅ Python lint completed
🔒 Python Security
✅ Python security scan completed
```

### Create Artifacts Stage
```
📦 Install Python dependencies and generate reports
✅ Python reports generated
📤 Upload Reports Artifact
✅ Uploaded artifact 'ci-cd-reports'
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: WeasyPrint Import Error
**Error**: `OSError: cannot load library 'gobject-2.0-0'`

**Cause**: Missing system dependencies

**Solution**: Already handled in workflow! The step:
```yaml
- name: 📦 Install WeasyPrint system dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 ...
```

This runs **before** pip install, so no issues! ✅

### Issue 2: Tests Fail
**Unlikely**, but if they do:
1. Check the error message in GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check if test files are up to date

**Solution**: All tests are mocked, so they should pass without issues

### Issue 3: PDF Not Generated
**Check**:
1. Is the `pdfs/` directory created?
2. Are there any permission errors?
3. Check the application logs

**Solution**: WeasyPrint is reliable - if dependencies are installed, it works!

## 📊 Success Metrics

After deployment, you should see:

### ✅ Pipeline Performance
- Build time: ~5-8 minutes (down from 10-15 with Playwright)
- All tests pass: 100%
- Coverage: >80%
- No critical vulnerabilities

### ✅ PDF Quality
- PDFs open correctly ✅
- CSS styling applied ✅
- Images rendered ✅
- Text properly formatted ✅

### ✅ Artifact Size
- Reports artifact: ~5-10 MB
- Source code artifact: ~2-5 MB
- Total: Much smaller than with Playwright dependencies
