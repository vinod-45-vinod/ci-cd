# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - CI/CD Pipeline

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend  
cd backend
npm install

# Python Service
cd python_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
playwright install-deps chromium
```

### 2. Test Locally (Before Pushing)

```bash
# Frontend Tests
cd frontend
npm run test:coverage  # Must pass with ‚â•75% coverage
npm run lint           # Must have zero errors

# Backend Tests
cd backend
npm run test:coverage  # Must pass with ‚â•75% coverage
npm run lint           # Must have zero errors

# Python Tests
cd python_service
pytest --cov=main --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=75  # Must pass
pylint main.py --fail-under=7.5                          # Must score ‚â•7.5/10
bandit -r . -ll                                          # Security scan
```

### 3. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete CI/CD pipeline with 6 stages and quality gates

- Implemented all 6 CI/CD stages (build, test, coverage, lint, security, artifact)
- Enforced 75% code coverage across all services
- Configured pylint with 7.5/10 minimum score
- Added comprehensive test suites (90+ tests)
- Configured security scanning (npm audit + bandit)
- Created deployment artifact stage with all reports
- Updated README with complete CI/CD documentation

Academic marks: 23/45 from CI/CD implementation"

git push origin main
```

### 4. Watch Pipeline Execute

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. Watch the pipeline execute through all 6 stages:
   - ‚úÖ Build (3 parallel jobs)
   - ‚úÖ Test (3 parallel jobs)
   - ‚úÖ Coverage (3 parallel jobs with ‚â•75% enforcement)
   - ‚úÖ Lint (3 parallel jobs with quality gates)
   - ‚úÖ Security (3 parallel jobs)
   - ‚úÖ Deployment Artifact (creates complete package)

### 5. Download Artifacts

After pipeline completes successfully:

1. Go to the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to **"Artifacts"** section at bottom
3. Download:
   - `deployment-artifact-complete` (full .zip package)
   - `frontend-coverage-report` (HTML coverage report)
   - `backend-coverage-report` (HTML coverage report)
   - `python-coverage-report` (HTML coverage report)
   - Lint and security reports

### 6. Update README Badges

Replace placeholders in README.md:

```markdown
![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/workflows/Academic%20CI/CD%20Pipeline%20-%20Article%20to%20PDF/badge.svg)
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR_REPO` with your repository name

Then commit and push the update.

## üéØ What Each Command Does

### Frontend Commands
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs Jest tests with coverage, fails if < 75%
- `npm run lint` - Checks code with ESLint, fails on any error
- `npm run build` - Creates production build

### Backend Commands
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs API tests with coverage, fails if < 75%
- `npm run lint` - Checks code with ESLint, fails on any error
- `npm start` - Starts Express server

### Python Commands
- `pytest --cov=main --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=75` - Runs tests with coverage
- `pylint main.py --fail-under=7.5` - Checks code quality, fails if score < 7.5
- `bandit -r . -ll` - Scans for security vulnerabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail Locally

1. **Clear caches**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend/Backend
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   
   # Python
   pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
   ```

2. **Check Python/Node versions**:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18.x
   python --version  # Should be 3.11.x
   ```

3. **Install Playwright manually**:
   ```bash
   cd python_service
   playwright install chromium
   playwright install-deps chromium
   ```

### If Pipeline Fails

1. **Check Actions tab** for detailed logs
2. **Look at the specific stage** that failed
3. **Run that stage's commands locally** to reproduce
4. **Fix the issue** and push again

### Common Issues

**Coverage Below 75%**: Add more tests to the affected service
**Lint Errors**: Run `npm run lint:fix` or fix Python code based on pylint output
**Security Vulnerabilities**: Review npm audit or bandit reports
**Build Failures**: Check Docker logs and dependency compatibility

1. ‚úÖ All local tests pass with ‚â•75% coverage
2. ‚úÖ All local lint checks pass with zero errors
3. ‚úÖ pylint scores ‚â•7.5/10
4. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions pipeline shows all green checkmarks
5. ‚úÖ Deployment artifact is created and downloadable
6. ‚úÖ All 6 stages complete successfully

## üéì For Academic Submission

Include these in your submission:

1. **GitHub repository URL** with working pipeline
2. **Downloaded deployment artifact** (.zip file)
3. **Coverage reports** (HTML files from artifacts)
4. **Screenshot of successful pipeline** (all 6 stages green)
5. **Reference to README.md** CI/CD section

This demonstrates:
- Complete CI/CD implementation (8 marks)
- Code coverage ‚â•75% (3 marks)
- Lint score ‚â•7.5 (included in 8 marks)
- Deployment artifact (5 marks)
- Documentation (2 marks)

## üÜò Need Help?

1. Review the main `README.md` for detailed documentation
2. Check `CI_CD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for complete overview
3. Look at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for pipeline configuration
4. Review individual test files for examples
5. Check configuration files (jest.config.js, pytest.ini, .pylintrc)
